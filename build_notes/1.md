- Usage of .gitignore:
    Git ignore is used to tell the git vcs to mark a folder/ file to be not tracked for future commits. If this is done before the first commit, the mentioned folder is hidden. If it is done after the repo is initialized, then we have manually clear the repo by using the command:
    `git rm --cached <file_name>` `git rm -r --cached <folder_name>`
- Why `const port = processor.env.port || 3000` ?
    Using 3000 as a port number is for the local environment only. localhost:3000. But if we want to deploy the backend in hosting platforms like heroku, Docker - then the assigned port number by that environment is used instead.
